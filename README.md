# Kannada_English_STS

This repository contains the code and data required for running semantic similarity between Kannada and English sentences
 Computation of semantic similarity is essential for a variety of tasks such as evaluating machine translation systems, quality checking in human translation, information retrieval, 
and plagiarism checks etc. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the semantic similarity of Kannada-English sentence pairs that uses embedding space alignment, lexical decomposition, 
word-order, and a convolutional neural network. The proposed method achieves a maximum correlation of 83% with the human annotations. Experiments on semantic matching and retrieval 
tasks resulted promising results in terms of precision and recall.
